        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>Graphic Designers today possess the ultimate power of communicating messages that visually stand out, thereby adding substantial emphasis to the existing content. Consulting with the client all the way through, and keeping the individual's or company's best interests in mind, graphic designers create their unique world with the combination of colors, illustrations, animations, print- and layout techniques and even photography.

Graphic Designers work closely together with the client - or in case of a large corporation - with the art- or creative director, in order to have a mutual understanding of the company's image and the desired effect they are intending to communicate. Following this important initial step, graphic designers prepare layouts (often computer-aided, though sometimes hand-drawn) in order to have an image of the design. Besides the visual elements we have already detailed, they could also select sound and type style, to further enhance the visual effects. In the eyes of a professional graphic designer, visual aids and content are two inseparable entities, when it comes to the final "look and feel".  </p>
